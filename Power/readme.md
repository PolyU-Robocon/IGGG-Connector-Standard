# IGGG Power Standard

## XT60(IGGG-pW-24V)
For most of application we will use XT60 connector for power(**12-36V power delivery**).  
For example, EPOS Power Cable(Molex Mini-Fit Jr.TM connector) convert to  XT60.   
Please noted that if you less than 12V you **are not recommend** to XT60
> I mean you cannot use XT60 for application that less than 12V. For 5V use DC jack or USB , Leung, M. (2021)
